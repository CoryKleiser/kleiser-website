                    <h2>Programmer</h2>
                    <p>I have great familiarity with the object oriented approach to design and development.
                        Most of my experience derives from developing applications on the client-side.
                        My language of choice is most definitely javascript and it's various frameworks.</p>

                    <h2>Multimedia</h2>
                    <p>Although my studies are focused on web, I am a competent producing many mediums.
                        I don't consider myself an expert photographer or videographer,
                        however the experience I have gained in these fields is of great use when developing responsive applications.</p>

                    <h2>Musician</h2>
                    <p>At age 5 I began playing my first instrument and never really stopped.
                        My love for playing music eventually spilled over into the studio. I am a proud member of the
                        Audio Engineering Society (AES),
                        and the former Vice President of AES, University of Cincinnati section.</p>

                    <h2>Traveler</h2>
                    <p>This world is so big and I would love to experience every inch of it.
                        Although I know this will never happen I truly enjoy visiting every place I can.
                        The human mind only grows when it is presented with new information,
                        and with every new experience comes new information.

                        <!--Whether I'm going to see family or just going to go, traveling is another one of my passions.
                        I truly enjoy exploring things I have never seen. I'm always looking to a new experience.
                        The feeling is even better when you share the experience with friends and family.--></p>
