                    <h2>Programmer</h2>
                    <p>I have great familiarity with the object oriented approach to design and development.
                        Most of my experience derives from developing applications on the client-side.
                        My language of choice is most definitely javascript and it's various frameworks.</p>

                    <p>Although my studies are primarily focused in web development, I am a competent producer
                        of many other mediums. The experience and knowledge I gain when creating various types of content
                        is invaluable when I am developing an application or website.</p>

                    <h2>Musician</h2>
                    <p>At age 5 I began playing drums, then piano and never stopped.
                        My love for playing music eventually spilled over into the studio.
                        I am a proud member of the Audio Engineering Society (AES),
                        and the former Vice President of AES, University of Cincinnati section.</p>
